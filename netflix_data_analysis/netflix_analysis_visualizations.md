A closer look at this data by grouping it by type of content shows us the distribution and popularity of type of content consumed by each country. US produces twice as many movies as TV shows while in India, this ratio is 10x. UK has an almost equal ratio while in Japan and South Korea, this is flipped.

Analysing the last 2 decades of data, we notice that the movie industry experienced a boom in 2016 with the number of movies released being 2.7 times more than the number of TV shows released but eventually died down in 2019 when binge watching TV shows became all the rage.
