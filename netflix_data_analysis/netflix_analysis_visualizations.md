70% of the content on Netflix are movies. Movies typically have a finite duration and tell a complete story within that timeframe. This format allows for a concentrated and immersive viewing experience, often attracting a broad range of audiences. Series, on the other hand, involve multiple episodes or seasons, requiring a longer time commitment from viewers. This tendency works not only for Netflix, but for the whole indusrtry in general.

A majority of the content is from US (3639 titles) followed by India releasing a third of what US does, trailed by UK and Canada. The entertainment market in the United States stands as the world's largest, not only in terms of its extensive domestic audience and global influence but also because of its substantial investments and industry infrastructure. This combination enables the creation of diverse content. Similarly, countries like India, known for its enormous population and flourishing film sector, especially Bollywood, also possess a substantial domestic market and are renowned for their high content output. Economic factors are pivotal in stimulating production and drawing investments in these contexts.

A closer look at this data by grouping it by type of content shows us the distribution and popularity of type of content consumed by each country.

Over the course of the last two decades, a discernible trend emerges when we closely examine the data related to the film and television industry. In the year 2016, this industry witnessed a remarkable upsurge, marked by a substantial increase in the number of movies released. During that year, the number of movies released was nearly 2.7 times greater than the number of TV shows introduced to the audience. However, this cinematic boom appeared to reach its zenith in 2019. Around this time, there was a noticeable shift in consumer preferences, with binge-watching TV shows becoming an increasingly popular pastime. This shift in viewing habits had a tangible impact on the industry, with the movie production frenzy gradually subsiding (likely due to the pandemic impacting production).

This data provides us with another valuable insight when we analyze the pattern of content releases throughout the year, broken down by quarters. A noticeable trend emerges as we observe that a significant portion of content is typically released towards the latter part of the year. In particular, the months of November and December are often referred to as the "awards season" for films. During this period, we see the release of some of the most highly anticipated and critically acclaimed movies. These are typically the films that become major contenders for prestigious awards, such as the Oscars. The choice to release these films towards the end of the year is strategic, as it allows them to stay fresh in the minds of award voters and benefit from increased visibility during the awards season.

Most of the top directors are from US or India. As discussed previously, economic factors, developed film industry and cultural aspect of movie industry have direct influence on the investment for producing large amount of movies for talanted directors. Those factors are most common in USA and India.

Netflix's target audience primarily comprises mature viewers, as evidenced by the prominence of content ratings like TV-MA and R. This demographic represents a substantial portion of their viewership. The second significant audience segment includes teenagers, as indicated by content rated TV-14 and TV-PG.
