## Netflix data analysis
Netflix is a widely-known streaming service renowned for its extensive collection of movies, TV shows, and original productions. The dataset we're working with here is a refined version of the original dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). This dataset encompasses content that was added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021, spanning a range from films and TV shows dating back to 1925 to the latest releases in 2021.

The primary objective of this project is to meticulously prepare and cleanse the data using Pandas followed by visualizing it using Tableau. This undertaking serves as a testbed to evaluate my proficiency in data cleaning and visualization.

Key Project Components:
1.Data Formatting and Preparations
2.Data Cleaning
3.Data Visualization
4. Conclusion and Analysis
